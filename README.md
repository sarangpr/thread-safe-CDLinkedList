========================

A thread safe Circular Double Linked LIst

Description: 

Built a circular doubly linked list that implements thread safe nature in two levels: Coarse Grained and Fine Grained. The CDLList uses Java synchronization constructs like AtomicIntegers and fundamental concurrency concepts like ReadWrite locks to improve efficiency of a thread safe data structure. The "sychronized" keyword used by java is often effective but gives a performance degrade. The project aims at learning fundamental concurrency problems and building solutions for them which not only provide thread safety but implement them in a efficient manner.
